## About Us

We are a group of early-career robotics students passionate about autonomous mobile robots. Our focus is on gaining practical experience using Python and the ROS 1 (Melodic) Navigation Stack. Through hands-on projects, we've developed an understanding of how robots perceive and interact with their environments via localization, sensor integration, and path planning.

Weâ€™ve completed multiple guided and self-initiated projects using tools such as **Gazebo**, **RViz**, and **ROS 1**, emphasizing robot simulation, SLAM-based navigation, and sensor setup with LIDAR and odometry data.
